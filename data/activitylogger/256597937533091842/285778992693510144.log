2017-06-18 06:41:24 #announcements @Zͨeͪpͬhͦyͫrͣ#4118: Are there any more menus
2017-06-18 06:41:39 #announcements @Zͨeͪpͬhͦyͫrͣ#4118: Shit it's 3am my bad
2017-06-18 14:31:04 #announcements @cncman30#6626: The skid GabenBS's Phoneix Menu just got shut down (PC)
2017-06-18 15:06:33 #announcements @CaptainJim#5590: @cncman30 Are we unable to mod at all today?
2017-06-18 15:29:54 #announcements @cncman30#6626: @CaptainJim im looking into other options but its not looking good
2017-06-18 16:02:08 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: @​everyone My guess is that if Take-Two Interactive is shutting down mod menus, they're going to shut down ALL mod menus. They're taking this VERY seriously if they're sending official C&D notices to major mod makers, especially to OpenIV.

2017-06-22 16:30:40 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: Alright @​everyone I'm gonna start a stream now, and im gonna set my bot to automatically tell y'all every time in this chat so we don't screw up everything. Remember, **do not** I repeat **DO NOT** talk about modding or anything on-stream. If you do, there's a chance that we'll be banned from the game and that I'll be banned from Twitch, so don't do that.

2017-06-22 21:08:05 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: @​everyone The money drop is delayed until @CaptainJim gets here. @cncman30 is having technical difficulties because Jordan's Menu no longer does moneybads, and Nigger Menu is being difficult.

He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him.\nPlease be warned there is a user going around called "KurtStarmer" or just "Kurt"  who is mass spamming terribly graphic gore and of such.

It is a scam and spreads by people passing it on to other servers. As always, if you see it, report it to discord like any other spam / malicious message you may receive.

I'll still be around in my free time , but I might tend to drop out of conversations because I had to get back to doing actual work. And I'll be around the rest of the week, unless I'm visiting colleges.
