Played just fine then, it was the RAM that ended up being a problem. Trying the dual core now though it was practically unplayable. What did Rockstar put the minimum specs at?

2017-01-19 18:24:31 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Long as the screen still good so is the pipe. What i do is remove the bowl. Wrap the rest in foil and into a heating pad to soften the resin without cooking it off. Easier to get out. I drop it in the bottle. Fill in my vape mix. Wrap up the bottle in foil put it in a heating pad turns up lil higher over night. Resin blends into the mix. I also evey hour take it out to shake  it when I was awake.
2017-01-19 18:25:41 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: That's how I made mine using left over resin.

2017-01-30 16:19:19 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: well the deck layout on mine a little akward when putting the coils in. there not much room to work with on the deck of my RDA.
2017-01-30 16:22:41 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: the walls of the cap also get to close when the coils put in. try to put in space then the coil makes contact in the wrong places. so it tosses the resistance off.
2017-01-30 16:22:50 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: its a cheap annoying RDA. lol
2017-01-30 16:28:08 #member @cncman30#6626: I like a velocity style deck
2017-01-30 16:28:48 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: yeah, with my deck, the coil has to be tight so a very thin wick. so thanks to the deck if not careful it bites you.

2017-01-30 16:32:33 #member @cncman30#6626: Super cheap vape stuff
2017-01-30 16:33:07 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: i thought about switching back to a fillable tank full time again. i keep one on the eleaf. but its a clone. and cuz its a clone its got a defect. the spring in my eleaf gets around it. but there is no spring in my ipv4.  there a metal rod that joins the base and contact to the under coil. its like a micron too short.
2017-01-30 16:33:32 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: yeah ive looked around there. but new vape stuff low on my list atm
2017-01-30 16:33:37 #member @cncman30#6626: Yeah clone tanks are no good
2017-01-30 16:33:47 #member @cncman30#6626: Rdas are ok tho
2017-01-30 16:35:51 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: the clone works fine, its just that contact rod. but i do have a real atomizer deck for it on there thats rebuildable, and its a tank that dont use gaskets. I hate ones that do. they crap out in no time flat. another thing about my RDA i dun care for. it uses a rubber gasket to seal the cap. I am on my last spare gasket for that one.
2017-01-30 16:37:20 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: the gasket goes loose  on my RDA the cap can fall off and get lost. and on a tank if it had one. it could go bad and leak like hell.
2017-01-30 16:37:44 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: So yeah. not gonna buy anymore that takes gaskets. screw ons only.
2017-01-30 16:39:42 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: well i take that back. my tank does have a rubber gasket in the mouth tip piece. but that only comes off during cleaning. not so often so they are still good after a year.
2017-01-30 16:41:18 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: whats funny is i think the real version of my tank has more gaskets then the clone does. lmao
2017-01-30 16:41:31 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: so aside from the contact rod. i like it better then the real one.
2017-01-30 16:43:12 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: its also a sub ohm so once i take care of the contact rod. it be bitchen on my IPV4 Mod. (attachment saved to 275667244237717504_black_crown_sub_ohm_tank_uwell.jpeg)

2017-02-28 21:55:06 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Why would this Nadeko thing say nice after I do? That's dumb, right? It should say nice when stuff actually is. Like when C puts a picture up or something. Downvote.
2017-02-28 21:56:34 #member @VyrenGames#3859: It was perfectly timed though. Also, its hard to edit the bot to say "nice" when C posts a picture.
2017-02-28 21:56:47 #member @VyrenGames#3859: I might try to do that though.
2017-02-28 21:59:01 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I just don't think that it serves any purpose. Someone already said nice. If an actual person was saying nice all the time just because I did they'd certainly get clocked.

2017-03-13 03:50:04 #member @VyrenGames#3859: @​everyone \nAlright, can we just take a second and talk about whatever's been going on these last couple weeks? This crew has gone from feeling like a family to feeling like a job these past few weeks. I don't know if y'all realize this, but I've been keeping an eye on Grapes while we play, and whenever he starts to get legit distressed I change the subject, create a distraction, or something else to defuse the situation. I know Cnc has been really good with self-moderation, and Jim... well, he's always doing something else not paying any attention whatsoever. Maybe Grapes got more touchy, I don't know. \n\nI think one really simple, easy fix is whenever anyone (especially Grapes) starts to actually get upset, just back off. Don't make fun of them or call them immature or anything like that. Just give them space. Don't ask them what you did (someone else can probably tell you that), at least until they calm down.
2017-03-13 03:53:08 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: He melted down in under 5 minutes mainly by himself. I didnt really say anything untill after he raged out of the game telling him to chill. All that in under 5 minutes. self-moderation i am sorry to say wont get very far in the long run when he looses his shit when someone kills him even once. During a event where everyone was killing each other no less. too stupid i think.

2017-03-13 04:04:19 #member @VyrenGames#3859: And now for those of you who don't understand this plea, let me ask you this: if another driver has road rage, do you purposely try to piss them off and make them want to actually shoot you? No. So why do that to a fellow player in a game? Games are supposed to be fun, not trying. \n\nAnd now let's look at it from the perspective of the victim: If you go to the ice cream shop with a group of friends and you step on the heels of one of your friends, causing them to trip and get injured, do you act all confused and righteous? Do you insult them, saying "Why are you so clumsy?" or "Learn how to walk you idiot!"? No, you don't. The same concept applies here. We're all friends here, right?
2017-03-13 04:12:01 #member @VyrenGames#3859: There's a thing called (something like) Virtual Anonymity Syndrome that affects the majority of people these days. Basically what that means is that because people don't see another person there with them when interacting online (using text chat, voice chat, etc.), people with that mindset tend to treat each other like they're disposable or like they don't matter. Like their actions won't have a lasting effect on anyone. \n\nEver since I first learned about that I started seeing examples of it everywhere. Please, just take a second @​everyone and see if that describes you.
2017-03-13 04:17:57 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Im just gonna say this for this event tonight. Yes Grapes got way too touchy. I am not trying to ignore what your saying. I get it 100%. But here the thing. Yes it was a game, it was king of the hill. Everyone was killing everyone else. I was having a decent play tonight which is rare as you know I stink at GTA. I am no pro gamer. He never seen me loose my shit when he randomly decide to whale on me in game or anyone else like unleashed. Me and you even share laughs when you kill me. Just because i was gaining a upper hand on him for a really short event that i would of stopped after words. he lost his shit. I wont say sorry for wanting to try to win once in awhile.\n\n Only thing i am sorry for is that he is this way and i hope he grows out of it. I had to deal with someone just like him for 6 years. It was hell. Sneeze near them by mistake get ready for hell from them.  If he had more control over his emotions, and been like how you killing me so well. I would of told him how, and he could of started whaling on me more. \n\nOne thing he needs to learn is he cant have it his way all the time. Which i dont think he has ever learned if mommy so easily hands over a credit card to buy a game he gets banned from again.

Most of the work being done is changing theme code, and putting in all the goodies and stuff.  Its google intensive as its using a google groups for forum chatting, and pages are all hosted under a blogger setup, and a theme i twisted around to not look so much like a blog, and retain most of the look of the old long linked site.  Not all pages are setup yet so no worrys if clicking some links do nothing. lol

2017-03-27 23:05:19 #member @VyrenGames#3859: You could have a list were each item links to a separate page with all the details in it.
2017-03-27 23:05:34 #member @VyrenGames#3859: I agree Jim.
2017-03-27 23:05:47 #member @VyrenGames#3859: Especially for streaming.
2017-03-27 23:05:50 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I was thinking a standard list with link to full details to the forum. but again im still looking
2017-03-27 23:06:36 #member @VyrenGames#3859: Also, as a sidenote, I don't really know how forums work because I never use them, so if you think a forum is a good idea then sure why not.
2017-03-27 23:06:38 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: as for voice chat clutter, most likly seperate voice chats. MIght set up a couple private channels. So if we have that many, we can setup as teams.
2017-03-27 23:06:57 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: OH i been screwing with them for years. lol
2017-03-27 23:07:22 #member @VyrenGames#3859: Also, that would be useful if some of us decide to do a mission, and others stay in freemode.
2017-03-27 23:07:31 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: i recall using phpBB when it was still very new. lol
2017-03-27 23:07:45 #member @VyrenGames#3859: But yeah, if we do teen missions, definitely set up new voice chat channels for each team.

2017-04-09 21:01:00 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: How to get a free TV. You see a tv through someones window you want. buy a cheap remote with a step program function. So all you have to do is push one button till the tv shuts off, then its programmed. Never make a peep and dont be seen. Keep shutting it off when ever you see it on. Wait for them to in time come home with a new TV and put the other with the trash. Free TV.   :3

I would plug this into the laptop ( https://tinyurl.com/mrovo4r), then plug this ( https://tinyurl.com/mxxralf ) into that, and the desktop into it.  So then if it works right will display my desktop directly to my laptop. Picture may not be the most pretty going through an RCA Converter. But think they can do widescreen 720p at the lest on the output. \n\nether  of them don't say much on there output resolution, but enough of their supported input resolutions. But if it works decent enough near $18 top vs the over $100+ capture devices that handle full HDMI (or dvi inputs, without having to convert the signal to an s-video or composite).

He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can.

2017-04-27 18:02:12 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Look at all the retailers there. Last time I did that gamestop had it for a little over 20. Looks like they don't now. G2A you can get it for 30. So if nobody beats them I guess that's the best bet.
2017-04-27 18:22:27 #member @frncloud#5554: I was hoping to find a digital code for retail because if I got the steam version I would probably have to re-download the game and that would take forever. But you can't find the retail codes for less then $50 unless you get the whole disc set which I don't need. The disc set is $39.89.
2017-04-27 19:05:12 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: steam version download is rather pointless thought. Far as i know steam will see your account owns a copy so it wont let you buy again on the same account. So have to on another steam account if you go steam. But in ether case. Long as the files are on the computer, and mods removed. There is no need to redownload at all. Just log in with the steam login with the new copy GTA. The steam client will see the files are already installed, so you just lunch it normally. \n\nSame for non steam (which would be the same on the hard copy too). just use a the new social club login on the launcher

2017-04-28 22:33:55 #member @CaptainJim#5590: You can change it as many times as you want.
2017-04-28 22:35:39 #member @CaptainJim#5590: If you change it make sure you change the email and password TWICE. The first time you do it an email will be sent for notification of the change. An email goes out for the email and the password and each email includes a link to revert the change. So you have to do it twice to nullify the first two emails to the original account owner.
2017-04-28 22:35:52 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Then you'll have it until they contact Rockstar manually either by email or phone.

2017-05-03 20:14:39 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: But a PSU converts house AC power to DC Power (like in your car) There only a loose of power the longer the cable. And the adapters are about as long as a finger. not really much to cry home about
2017-05-03 20:14:46 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: and its likely 500 watts
2017-05-03 20:14:51 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: 500volts would be stupid.
2017-05-03 20:15:13 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: PSU if they have a region switch is 120 volts or 240 volts.
2017-05-03 20:15:29 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: whatever your wall outlets put out commonly in your region.

2017-05-03 20:15:51 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: so could i get a gtx 1050ti 4gb?
2017-05-03 20:17:14 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Thats entirely up to you. But I will say if its within your power i would go ahead and get a new PSU also. It be a good upgrade. But I see no issue with a adapter. long as you meet the power resuirements of the gpu.
2017-05-03 20:17:47 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: so maybe to play it safe if you go adapter. go with one like this instead of the other i linked

2017-05-03 20:38:18 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Well back in the 90s that was more of a worry. it was more easy to plug things in upside down. Today. there more plug in play really. They have spacers that only allow them to plug in one way. really the hardware parts the easier one. Its going into the BIOS and setting up boot orders for the model of mobo (which many of them are simlar enough). And run OS Installtions.

2017-05-03 21:26:34 #member @frncloud#5554: So far it only happens when I start up the one game.
2017-05-03 21:39:52 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: It would be my best guess. Only moving parts are fans and hard drives. Which ever you feel maybe making the nose could could be a drying bearing. Which ether case needs to be taken care of. more so if a hard drive.
2017-05-03 21:41:32 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: If its a fan, a few bucks and swap it not all that a big deal. Hard drive if its making the nose. Back it up asap before it cant spin up. as to why it might only do it with one game is a little odd. Sure the sounds not coming from your speakers?
2017-05-03 21:43:42 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Maybe start me over on whats going on in detail best you can and maybe i can narrow the field.
2017-05-03 21:46:22 #member @frncloud#5554: When I start Sims 3 I hear a high pitch whistling / screeching sound coming from my computer. I have tested all of my other games and none of them cause that sound to emit.

2017-05-03 21:48:44 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Sims 3 can be a little hard on the hard drive. Its hard to say without hearing it myself
2017-05-03 21:49:32 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Are the speakers off when you start the game?
2017-05-03 21:49:53 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: if it sounds like metal contact id say hard drive bearings.

2017-05-04 14:31:58 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: the setup will start and youll reach a step that has a disc manager. that will do the work (but be careful if you dun wanna loose windows. dont wanna format the whole disk. lol)

2017-05-04 14:33:36 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: well i suppse you could parition a segment of the drive. use a program to install the setup disk to the partition, and boot into it that way. but its just safer to do it with a USB if you scared about formating away your windows install.

2017-05-05 11:39:24 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Remember when you said you didnt care about windows. i told if you if that was so go ahead and use the whole hard drive. what did you do? Linux broke nothing. You used the whole drive.  @UnL34sHd
2017-05-05 11:41:09 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I warned you so stop blaming Linux. You cant use the builtin recovery. you have to use a full windows install disc and boot from it like the linux disc. thats how you reinstall windows.
2017-05-05 14:50:02 #member @CaptainJim#5590: So then the screenshot is with a windows disk inserted somehow?
2017-05-05 14:50:23 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Because if not why is Windows doing anything?

2017-05-05 15:32:28 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: booting from the CD ignores linux all together. During the setup you need to reformat the hard drive.
2017-05-05 15:32:39 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: The CD will then install WIndows back onto the drive.
2017-05-05 15:32:48 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: it tells me stuff about drivers and sht
2017-05-05 15:34:18 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: but linux isnt the blame. A step is being missed if your still running into errors. Linux does not break a system in that way.
2017-05-05 15:34:25 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: wait a sec let me get everything setup

2017-05-05 16:26:46 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: it would not be there you know
2017-05-05 16:26:53 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: yeah the linux mint disc uses grub. but it wouldnt cause that.
2017-05-05 16:27:56 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: its taking a while
2017-05-05 16:28:08 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: ill see if it logs me in or it logs mint in

2017-05-05 16:30:24 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Yeah.
2017-05-05 16:38:14 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: With the drive now all formated. A working windows boot disc should start up on its own and start setup.
2017-05-05 16:39:45 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: disk is not reading im gonna try other ones
2017-05-05 16:40:11 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: i think it was the glitched disk anyway
2017-05-05 16:41:16 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Long as the disc is good, with the drive now bootless it wont boot at all without a working disc. So once you find a working disc should see it start setup on its own.
2017-05-05 16:41:36 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: seeing how the hard drives no longer bootable. but the setup will make it bootable again.
2017-05-05 16:42:05 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: i got the press any key thing
2017-05-05 16:42:17 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: Thx troy
2017-05-05 16:42:21 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Nah, with the drive now empty it should do it on its own
2017-05-05 16:42:22 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: once again
2017-05-05 16:45:19 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: i would not see any errors but if there is i will say
2017-05-05 16:45:23 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: and send a picture
2017-05-05 16:45:46 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: but in logic with the hard drive wiped and is not being deticated it should just load
2017-05-05 16:46:01 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I am also downloading a fresh 8.1 ISO incase you need a guide. so if so have your desktop ready so you can see better then on your phone screen.
2017-05-05 16:46:13 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: but yeah that is correct.
2017-05-05 16:46:15 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: ok or not
2017-05-05 16:46:37 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Because the disc should be the only bootable now.

2017-05-05 19:50:44 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: normally when i see an error like that after setup there something wrong with the disc that maybe not visable to the naked eye but the rom couldnt read it properlly and setup just skiped it over (which is dumb because you get errors later)

2017-05-05 20:39:19 #member @CaptainJim#5590: My imagination is in the wrong place then.
2017-05-05 20:39:21 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: but it went from win 8 to 8.1 back to win 8 than to win 10 and than linux
2017-05-05 20:39:53 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Sounds like some power regulation caps are bad or have bad solder points.
2017-05-05 20:40:16 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: gonna have to salvage the mobo
2017-05-05 20:40:18 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: and parts

2017-05-05 20:41:00 #member @CaptainJim#5590: The board sounds fine.
2017-05-05 20:41:09 #member @CaptainJim#5590: What gave you that indication?
2017-05-05 20:41:25 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: It kicks off allot when the disc drive is in play
2017-05-05 20:41:37 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: its most stable when its not using it
2017-05-05 20:42:42 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Well it will now especially because that's what the windows disc doesn't have. Drivers for the CD drive. The G6 I pulled up comes with 7. What's the full model number?
2017-05-05 20:43:21 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: The lack of drivers wouldnt kick it off without users input
2017-05-05 20:44:06 #member @CaptainJim#5590: A lack of drivers would cause unpredictable effects.
2017-05-05 20:44:16 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: only while in the OS
2017-05-05 20:44:28 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Its done it pre OS boot also
2017-05-05 20:44:51 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: A Driver is not initalized till the OS is booted
2017-05-05 20:45:33 #member @CaptainJim#5590: A driver isn't being initialized. That's what the error is.
2017-05-05 20:45:57 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Again this has happen before a OS Boot before. So the driver is not the cause
2017-05-05 20:46:09 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Its happen even in BIOS while a disc is in the drive
2017-05-05 20:46:41 #member @CaptainJim#5590: What exactly is happening? So now the cd drive is broken? And the board is broken?
2017-05-05 20:47:05 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I think there is a short somewhere when a disc in the drive at boot.
2017-05-05 20:47:24 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: When there no disc in there he has less issues
2017-05-05 20:47:47 #member @CaptainJim#5590: How so?
2017-05-05 20:47:58 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: He stated it had a history of being dropped.
2017-05-05 20:48:11 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I mean with no disk now it won't even boot right? Isn't the hard drive all mixed up now?
2017-05-05 20:48:15 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: well it is heating up the pc
2017-05-05 20:48:20 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: cuz the thing is in use
2017-05-05 20:48:27 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: so it is more heat
2017-05-05 20:48:38 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Yeah and HP runs hot on your lap.
2017-05-05 20:48:43 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: The kick offs happen mainly when the disc drive is in play BIOS and all. Drivers dont go into effect till OS boot so it cant be drivers. Stright as that.
2017-05-05 20:48:43 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I remember that haha.
2017-05-05 20:49:06 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I'm not saying the drivers are an issue with the computer physically.
2017-05-05 20:49:18 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I'm saying they're an issue with the windows installation.
2017-05-05 20:49:36 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Is windows 8 the OS the computer had out of the gate?
2017-05-05 20:49:44 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: yes
2017-05-05 20:49:51 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I agree one of the disc or all maybe screwy. but they them selfs wouldnt kick off the system. even the fresh linux disc did it couple times.
2017-05-05 20:50:11 #member @CaptainJim#5590: A fresh linux disk did what?
2017-05-05 20:50:17 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Kick off what?
2017-05-05 20:50:27 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: A couple times when he tried to boot into the live disc the system kicked off.
2017-05-05 20:51:18 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Unexpected loss of power?
2017-05-05 20:51:22 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: If i had to guess. at one point of a fall. a solder point was knocked loose or a cap damaged. Vibrations on disc rom speed up triggers the shorts, and poor contact can cause a heat up.
2017-05-05 20:52:02 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Kinda like taking a fuse out and putting in one thats too low on amps. and it keeps poping.
2017-05-05 20:52:27 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I'm not guessing. You're stating the pc incurred a complete unexpected loss of power on multiple occassions while a disk was being read?
2017-05-05 20:52:46 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: yes.
2017-05-05 20:53:52 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Its what sounds like it to me, and from what i know of HP Quility.
2017-05-05 20:54:05 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Im not saying it is 100% that.
2017-05-05 20:54:10 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: just most likly.
2017-05-05 20:54:15 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Well when ya drop shit, ya know lol
2017-05-05 20:54:59 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: It just sounds like a bad connection somehwhere inside the laptop. If you want me to just sum it up. lol
2017-05-05 20:55:33 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: The boards main logic chips and all are fine. because it still post when it powers on.
2017-05-05 20:57:10 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: tried it

2017-05-05 20:57:34 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: bleh... guess the drivers on 10 are too new for 8.
2017-05-05 20:57:59 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: was worth of try. might of worked if it was the other way around. lol
2017-05-05 20:58:09 #member @CaptainJim#5590: The error means it's not getting them from the installation media.
2017-05-05 20:58:27 #member @CaptainJim#5590: For the installation media.
2017-05-05 20:58:54 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Really what is the model number?
2017-05-05 20:58:55 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: He needs a new Windows media with the generic drivers or a disc with the right drivers for the version of windows.
2017-05-05 20:59:48 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I think a windows 7 disk is going to be most likely to have the correct generic drivers for a laptop cd drive.
2017-05-05 20:59:59 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: nope
2017-05-05 21:00:05 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: He got another blank disc?

2017-05-05 21:10:09 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Yupp. I still say go win 7 64bit. I'd put that on and use the exe upgrade to ten.
2017-05-05 21:10:42 #member @CaptainJim#5590: The laptop originally came with windows 7. This one was made after the change so it got 8, but the hardwarw was originally designed for 7.
2017-05-05 21:11:36 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Yeah, but looks like they dont support the drivers anymore for windows 7 for the G6. there only showing windows 8 and 8.1 and 10 has the generic drivers.

2017-05-05 21:11:52 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Which means 7 should have the driver and if it doesn't I'd recommend replacing the disk drive or fixing the usb. More than likely this won't work because you already tried twice.
2017-05-05 21:12:01 #member @UnL34sHd#8574: Its not booting into the windows 7 disk

2017-05-05 21:14:33 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: some should have generic drivers but not all do. I think its retail disk that have them and not OEM ones unless you use a certain OEM Disk would it have the drivers.

2017-05-05 21:22:53 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Either the disk burned to quick or the laptop can't read from the cd drive.

2017-05-05 21:47:31 #member @CaptainJim#5590: The last simple thing I'd try before spending money is cleaning the cd reader anyway I could. Compressed air if you have it. A dry cloth if you can reach (probably not). Fails after that you should start replacing parts. Starting with the cd drive.

2017-05-09 21:58:39 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: Only reason why tethering worked on my phone was because i removed the stock android that had the lock in place also. So with the glitch and 3rd party android i could tether.

2017-05-10 23:59:35 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Yeah, they're pretty stupid to not just take care of this. I'm not fond of the service based on what you've told me.
2017-05-11 00:00:08 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Surely they could have tried to sell you an adapter that matches while they do the warranty exchange on it.
2017-05-11 00:00:29 #member @Grapes#5121: They could have at least packed it good
2017-05-11 00:01:45 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I don't get why it has to go across the country anyway, but yeah I hope it all gets worked out Grapes.
2017-05-11 00:02:08 #member @CaptainJim#5590: You could get a replacement on amazon pretty cheap if they say it's going to take more weeks or whatever.
2017-05-11 00:04:05 #member @Grapes#5121: It's bullshit too because they can't find the serial number so they brought it to bigger people and now it's going to go to big people. And they " cant send an adapter over here. We have to send it back then they fix it and then send it back.

2017-05-11 02:14:24 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: @CaptainJim @Grapes  Sorry wasnt at the computer. I would say order a replacement online also. the price of a oem replacement is just stupid. and i wouldnt try to bend the DC Connector. If there a break and they cross polls you could blow your system destorying it. \n\nI see in one of the pics shows the box unit that has two adapters in it. Which looking at online what a G20 used was a 230 and a 180 watts. My guessing the g20 uses a board simlar to a laptops using the 180 for the board itself, and the 230 for the Express slots. \n\nhttp://a.co/dzmFGfU (230 watt)\n\nhttp://a.co/hCseCjm (180 watt)\n\nSuch a rather dumb costly design. So if the warranty covers a replacement i would do it first. Because its allot money.

So dont know who your reking on. Breaks ins and bad software will always get by in the end the OS type dont matter. Its why like i said the other day. Keep up with OS upgrades and protection software. I never what OS. For me Linux is just beter for my needs while windows is not.

2017-06-01 16:19:54 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Oh yeah. It's super fucked up Troy. This has been an issue for like a year. It's a bluetooth 4.0 adapter (usb) and a little headset. Not a gaming thing like what grapes showed us. More of a douchebag with a cellphone type headset. It might be too cheap, I've considered buying another one to see if that solves the issue. But what happens is so complex. Hard to explain. \n\nSo the headset connects fine. Brings up two new audio devices. M26 and M26 (stereo)\n\nM26 stereo is beautiful. But if you use that for audio then the microphone is forced into telephony quality. \n\nIf you reverse them then you get a good mic, but your audio goes to telephony.
2017-06-01 16:21:31 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I've worked on this on and off for a long time without any success. Driver changes, windows setting changes, nothing helps. So maybe I'll just pricier headset when I get the money and see if that works.
2017-06-01 16:21:55 #member @CaptainJim#5590: This one was like 9 bucks, I think.
2017-06-01 16:24:08 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: ive debated on going wireless, but i just stick wired. I love my headphones. just need a better mic. I might get something like this. http://a.co/6RetaEF

You might be able to find it if you know the model number for the PC. Best bet would be calling them or Asus or whomever is working your case and just asking for the model number of that part.

2017-06-03 03:03:53 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: not uncommon for a infection to mess with permssions to make it harder to remove.
2017-06-03 03:41:56 #member @Wojak#0946: Holy crap that took way longer than it should have, I wasn't able to delete the adware, but I was able to move it to a spot where it can't be executed and I managed to disable all the hidden extensions it installed on my browsers

2017-06-03 17:01:30 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Nah. Even from bios I think you get to choose.

2017-06-03 17:01:56 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I'd be nervous I missed a part of the infection tho. So my personal preference would be to format the drive.
2017-06-03 17:01:57 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: just cant recall off hand which is default. I dun think it formats by default. have to tell it too.
2017-06-03 17:02:38 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: A reinstall would reset the start up services. So if he dont format. it would still be there. just dead unless he starts something containing it still.
2017-06-03 17:03:07 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: So a back up and full format before reinstall i would advice doing.
2017-06-03 17:17:25 #member @CaptainJim#5590: If you back up you have to make sure what you backup isn't infected.
2017-06-03 17:18:18 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I don't really think we have enough information to properly advise the situation. No clue what folders that thing is in.
2017-06-03 17:19:24 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: normally the infections hide in the system32 or program files folders.

Here's the power info. What if you bought two adapters? What are your thoughts? (attachment saved to 322440826011779082_JPEG_20170608_132438.jpg)
2017-06-08 18:25:12 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: I already knew that. i looked up his system back when he got his system back the first time.
2017-06-08 18:25:24 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Thanks for answering my question Troy....
2017-06-08 18:26:27 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: One for the board the other for the PCI Express and other hungry parts. The cost is rather nutty.
2017-06-08 18:26:31 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I'm just saying wouldn't it be possible to buy two non asus adapters with these ratings and use those?
2017-06-08 18:26:44 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Instead of the 150 dollar asus one.
2017-06-08 18:26:45 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: yeah its possible.
2017-06-08 18:27:02 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: long as the connection fits and the specs are the same.
2017-06-08 18:29:18 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: even non factory oem ones the cost still gets pretty high.
2017-06-08 18:31:29 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Yeah and you'd have to get two. So I'm still not sure it's feasible. But at least I know what I'm trying to find.
2017-06-08 18:31:49 #member @CaptainJim#5590: The best option is this upbright comany and you'd be over buying a new one at that point.
2017-06-08 18:32:33 #member @Sen#1089: anybody want to play?
2017-06-08 18:33:10 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: honestly at the price even for non oems if it where up to me. Id gut the g20s parts, and get a board that could take them along with a case and standard PSU. Cut out the annoying shit bits Asus forces. lol

2017-06-08 18:39:42 #member @CaptainJim#5590: First one is over on amps. Only by a little, but I wouldn't risk it. Second one spot on, yes.
2017-06-08 18:39:55 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: the slight amp over wont hurt it.
2017-06-08 18:40:25 #member @CaptainJim#5590: I wouldn't advise it. You can haha.
2017-06-08 18:40:46 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Rather be under than over. It's sad when they burn up.
2017-06-08 18:41:04 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: The system has its own protection onboard to protect it. and infact a under amps is more damaging then a over.

2017-06-08 18:41:47 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: a slight incress wouldnt hurt. if there damage your talking more then slight lol

2017-06-08 18:42:25 #member @CaptainJim#5590: That's all. Might be a risk I could take on my own shoulders. But not on poor grapes.
2017-06-08 18:44:08 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: i wouldnt see it as one. a slight incress shouldnt hurt it really. too much yes. little under hell no dont attempt it. it forces the caps in the system to pull more energry then the supply can put out. it would burn it out. Its always a false thing to think its better to go slightly under then over by a small amp.
2017-06-08 18:44:17 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: but if you insist its little more. http://a.co/i3idlNq
2017-06-08 18:47:03 #member @CaptainJim#5590: His mom wouldn't do it if we're still at 100 bucks.
2017-06-08 18:47:10 #member @CaptainJim#5590: Worth a try tho.
2017-06-08 18:49:05 #member @TroyFoxxin#9341: well if you wanna hit specs nail on head kinda shit out of luck with that to get under 100. lol only way to would be to order chinese versions and those things are poorly shielded and use sub standard caps. so bad idea there. lol

2017-06-20 16:52:49 #member @cncman30#6626: Due to the current situation with Take Two, Jordans Menu has transferred ownership to a third party that intends to continue development. Even though making game cheats is not illegal, the prospect of legal costs means that it is no longer viable for me to continue with this project. The new owners will be moving the website to a different domain in the coming days, you can be rest assured that your existing accounts will still work and you will not need to re-purchase it. @​everyone
