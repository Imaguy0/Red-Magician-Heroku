2017-02-27 14:27:08 #announcements @TroyFoxxin#9341: Welcome to the announcements channel. Its understandable you may not want notifications going off every second some times. But still wanna be invited when something good happens like invite to play a game. You can lower your notifications to only @mentions, and set the announcements  channel to All. If all works right, your computer or mobile device will only alert you when someone is talking to you and use @mentions to get your attention or when someone uses the announcements channel. Please only use it as such and not spam on it or have a chat in it, use PMs or Public chat channels. Thank You! üòÉ

2017-03-06 23:05:58 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: Indeed @‚Äãeveryone! @cncman30 @CaptainJim and I just figured out how to pick people up from the water with a Buzzard, but there are still more projects yet to be completed!

2017-04-14 18:07:22 #announcements @CaptainJim#5590: A rust server for science now exists. Still a few things to configure and I have no idea how many players it'll be able to handle. Nevertheless it is up and you should be able to find it in the server list under the title: \n\nMeera Vista Nerissa - For Science

2017-04-19 17:40:12 #announcements @CaptainJim#5590: MIRA VISTA NERISSA -FOR SCIENCE\n\n\nIs the server even up?\n\n\nIS IT UP!? It absolutely is up! Now with OXIDE (cheaty hax!) the server can be found in the modded section. The map is new again, sorry. I know it has changed a lot this week and last, but you can expect the server to be up and wipe free for at least the remainder of the month. The map I went with is barren (size:3000). This means that grass and bushes won't look as fancy. I challenge you to really notice that. The barren map should allow smoother play and increased player population. There were not issues with that before, but I'm trying to prepare for an influx of players should there be one. I have no idea what it takes to crash this out, it could be really easy. \n\n\nJust gonna get deleted anyway.\nVery very soon a wipe schedule needs to be created. This is something that effects every user on the server so I would appreciate as much feedback as possible before implementation on what you think would work. From what I have read a lot of servers have a bi-weekly or monthly wipe. Currently there is not an auto wipe schedule.
2017-04-19 17:40:27 #announcements @CaptainJim#5590: This announcement is really long. I don't even have rust installed!\n\nI am growing closer to creating a discord solely for this server. Maybe other rust servers in the future. After learning so much about rust though I am not really in the state of mind to dive into discord. There's a lot of useful functionality to take advantage of there. So if you would be interested in running a Discord for Meera Vista please let me know. Not something that needs to be started tomorrow, but I am searching. Just with Discord (It might not be that difficult) I'd like someone who can: Be co-owner and the sole individual responsible for changes and maintenance. Moving forward it is my intention to have a Discord bot that connects with the server to relay console information. I have looked at the plugin for Oxide, but not the bot for discord other than it exists so you'd be responsible for that side. There may be other bots or server functions to add as we grow. Mainly my goal is to create redundancy for server notifications. I.E If the server says it's going to restart then that will be reflected in the server text chat as well as a server notification channel in Discord.\n\n\nWait where's this live map all this shit started for in the first place?\n\nplayrust.io/map/?136.32.212.164:28015\n\nIt's right there, beaches! You can go to that link and see the map and any players that:\n\n1. Have chosen to share their location with you and\n2. Are logged in, not sleeping.\n\nFormal apology because you have to create an account or sign in with steam. I didn't notice that until I was done adding it. I did explore alternatives to see about getting around it, unfortunately one does not exist. There is a similar project I'll be keeping my eye on. Until then you can sign in with Steam, it's relatively quick and non-invasive.

2017-06-10 01:29:29 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: @‚Äãeveryone Just to clarify, I just notified Sen of our decision. For the record, this is a direct transcript of my message to Sen: \n\n"Well, the council has voted as it were, and you've been banned from my crew. You are simply too pushy and never really seemed to care about anyone but yourself, and I can no longer tolerate your mistreatment of my fellow crew members or myself. \n\nWe've given you several warnings (too many, even for me), but you refuse to listen so we had no other choice. My apologies, but this is the way things have to be. Best of luck to you."
2017-06-12 11:59:58 #announcements @cncman30#6626: New gta update drops tomorrow. \nMake sure to remove any mods you have installed today.
2017-06-13 16:05:16 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: @‚Äãeveryone I'm not gonna look at this Discord server until I get home tomorrow. I'll bet there will be tons of spoilers. If you need to contact me, send me a DM instead.

He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim aswell. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him.\nOur team is currently working very hard to remove this user from our database, please stay safe.\n\n-Discord team

2017-06-18 16:02:08 #announcements @VyrenGames#3859: @‚Äãeveryone My guess is that if Take-Two Interactive is shutting down mod menus, they're going to shut down ALL mod menus. They're taking this VERY seriously if they're sending official C&D notices to major mod makers, especially to OpenIV.

Remember, **do not** I repeat **DO NOT** talk about modding or anything on-stream.
