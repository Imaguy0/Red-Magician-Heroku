2017-06-21 14:39:05 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Is it possible to have just the #announcements from Discord shown?
2017-06-21 15:32:22 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: Yes.
2017-06-21 15:32:46 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: It's a bit of work to set up, but I can do that.
2017-06-21 15:54:32 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: maybe...
2017-06-21 15:54:39 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: technical difficulties
2017-06-21 15:55:55 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Just the announcements tho.
2017-06-21 15:55:58 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: And no rush.
2017-06-21 15:56:02 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: yep
2017-06-21 15:56:16 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: no, its just that the tool im using is being stubborn
2017-06-21 16:04:02 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: Ya, I'm gonna hold off on that for a while I guess,.

2017-06-21 17:12:16 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Were we able to include the map?
2017-06-21 18:15:07 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I need to test some codes out to try put a live map on it. The free web host does not like iframe code lol
2017-06-21 18:43:09 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I don't even know. Does Rust IO let you use there's? They might not allow it I suppose. That would be a better place to use it.
2017-06-21 18:49:55 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Our site, I mean.
2017-06-21 19:22:05 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: 512x256 is the banner size. If you could set aside a place I will provide the image later on. The server would pull it from the website.
2017-06-21 19:26:32 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I'm still thinking about how to make the map work but I could post a saved png or jpeg for now till I figure out how to make it live
2017-06-21 19:27:38 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Oh no. Please focus on the live map if it's salvageable.
2017-06-21 19:28:01 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I still plan too just saying can put something t there for the time being
2017-06-21 19:28:03 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I'm just saying there will be a banner. So if you want to just make a box for it now to know how the space is utilized.
2017-06-21 19:29:23 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Let me grab my laptoo
2017-06-21 19:30:41 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:YOUR-SERVER-PORT
2017-06-21 19:31:05 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Apparently that's where the map broadcasts from. And the IO lists it on there thing.
2017-06-21 19:31:22 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Sooo would that IP and port help you?
2017-06-21 19:31:37 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: if you need to know the size. the discord widget on the side currently 270x400 for side banners.
2017-06-21 19:31:48 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: that let you know general size.
2017-06-21 19:32:07 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: No I'm not sure I'm explaining this right.
2017-06-21 19:33:21 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: We will be making a banner for the server that is 512x256\n\nIt isn't done yet. So I'm informing you to zone that sized area somewhere on the website. It can be blank and say something like, under construction.
2017-06-21 19:33:43 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: would the footer be ok?
2017-06-21 19:33:59 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Yeah that would probably be fine.
2017-06-21 19:34:15 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: that the easest spot to place at
2017-06-21 19:35:23 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: onces the banner done just toss it at me. ill splice it in, and let me know if you want it clickable anywhere.
2017-06-21 19:37:06 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Not just a picture.
2017-06-21 19:37:12 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: kk
2017-06-21 19:37:17 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Here's what it looks like in game so you know.

2017-06-21 19:37:36 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Not ours. But the banner image.
2017-06-21 19:37:56 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: kk, just toss it when its done.
2017-06-21 19:38:12 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: So that's just zoning. The map is priority is there any info I can give to help us make that work.
2017-06-21 19:38:20 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I'm not sure they even allow it.

2017-06-21 19:40:11 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: well, i was gonna try to use iframe code to display the http://playrust.io/map/?136.32.212.164:28015 onto the site. but the host didnt like the code. So trying to find a away around it. I dun like the other options for host unless someone wants to pay for a web server for me to build on.

2017-06-21 19:41:34 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: if i had a better home connection id just host the entire server my self. I got a little atom system i used to use to host websites. lol
2017-06-21 19:41:44 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: If you take out the playrust part would it work?
2017-06-21 19:41:56 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Because it comes from me to them.
2017-06-21 19:42:09 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: So it starts at http://13 blah blah
2017-06-21 19:42:16 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: it dont matter. they blocked the iframe code entirelly.
2017-06-21 19:42:32 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I am not familiar with the iframe code.
2017-06-21 19:42:54 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: it be nice if playrust.io offered embed code.
2017-06-21 19:42:59 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I could host it, but I'd have to set up apache and other shit. A whole new system. Would be so time consuming.
2017-06-21 19:43:25 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: If i had a Linux VM to connect too i could set it up all myself.
2017-06-21 19:44:43 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I have one more computer.
2017-06-21 19:45:00 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: It's the oldest one.
2017-06-21 19:45:07 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I could ssh into a system with the right open ports and set it up.
2017-06-21 19:45:11 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: 500gb drive also oldest one.
2017-06-21 19:45:24 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Ssh is just text?
2017-06-21 19:45:33 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: yes
2017-06-21 19:45:42 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Dude let me think about it.
2017-06-21 19:46:07 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Even if I decide to sign up for that the next day I could is sometime next week.
2017-06-21 19:46:11 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Maybe Sunday.
2017-06-21 19:46:41 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: i know how to do all that shit in command line so ssh is all i need to manage it, and the right ports open for all that. which wouldnt be much.
2017-06-21 19:53:13 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: oh and as for the discord site widget. Discord's widget only allows showing so much. there no options to make it show chat. just what it shows now.
2017-06-21 20:06:25 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: To look at what you mean.
2017-06-21 20:06:25 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Can I have the site link again?
2017-06-21 20:17:24 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I found it scrolled up finally.
2017-06-21 20:17:33 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Discord gets so cluttered sometimes.

2017-06-21 20:32:33 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: And you said that the discord will only display users?
2017-06-21 20:32:37 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Is that correct?
2017-06-21 20:34:03 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I planned on removing them and anything can have a copyright. And yes. Just who online or in a voice channel
2017-06-21 20:34:42 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Okay so fuck it leave the discord thing.
2017-06-21 20:34:58 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Even though it's stupid we have nothing to put there.
2017-06-21 20:35:12 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Then if we take the 2 filler crap things out.
2017-06-21 20:35:50 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: We can smash the description in the middle. Looks like you have a link ti the map up there at least (blocked at work so I don't really know)
2017-06-21 20:36:09 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: How does that sound?
2017-06-21 20:36:37 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Yeah it's a start
2017-06-21 20:37:19 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Alright. Don't use the description we have, I have stuff to add and change still.
2017-06-21 20:37:31 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: So I'll shoot you the final draft soon.
2017-06-21 20:37:39 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: KK.

2017-06-21 21:06:23 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: It would just be a link to the actual website, so nothing special on our end.

2017-06-21 21:09:47 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: i dont get it
2017-06-21 21:09:54 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: But what do THOSE people want out of Rust? That's what I'm searching for.
2017-06-21 21:10:02 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: idk
2017-06-21 21:10:42 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Even though I don't like it I really want to provide it. Just because people like Graoes. They want it, but can't make it. I'll make it ya know. But how the fuck do they want it?
2017-06-21 21:10:58 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: lmao
2017-06-21 21:10:59 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Anyway. I'll figure that out eventually.

2017-06-21 21:21:05 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: Okay, so here's the code I have. Unfortunately because of the way they've built their service it's not very configurable, but it'll do for now until Discord comes out with their improved widget.

2017-06-21 21:22:13 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: KK I'll work on porting in the code later. Hot hot. Lol. And iframe ok just some web host block them
2017-06-21 21:22:48 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: no, but styling the content inside them is a pain in the old ass
2017-06-21 21:23:15 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: And I like this host cuz it's free and no anti idea if I dun log in so much later and account gets closed on inactives.
2017-06-21 21:23:35 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: perfect
2017-06-21 21:23:51 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Just the iframe block is in the way. Lol
2017-06-21 21:24:02 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: lol
2017-06-21 21:24:21 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: If the live map had a embed widget made it would work.

2017-06-21 21:26:40 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: ikr
2017-06-21 21:26:45 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: thats really annoying
2017-06-21 21:27:20 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: i didnt realize there was a way to block iframe use, but it makes sense there would be
2017-06-21 21:28:05 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Yeah, there allot of blocks u can place on a server so certain basic HTML won't even work.
2017-06-21 21:47:10 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Here's a question.
2017-06-21 21:47:28 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: If you have a paypal account, but with no linked cards or accounts.
2017-06-21 21:47:34 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Will it hold money?
2017-06-21 21:47:44 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: yes
2017-06-21 21:48:02 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: you just have to link an accout/card to get it out
2017-06-21 21:48:32 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: So if I trucked on down to walmart and bought one of those prepaid cards?
2017-06-21 21:48:53 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Then I could transfer money to it or whatever yeah? Until it expired.
2017-06-21 21:49:04 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: umm, i think so ya
2017-06-21 21:49:07 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: I haven't used those in so long.
2017-06-21 21:49:20 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: idk if you can put money back onto them tho
2017-06-21 21:49:22 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: idk
2017-06-21 21:49:25 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: me either
2017-06-21 21:58:38 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Prepaid bank cards aren't designed to work with PayPal so you can make it work but only if ur transering to the prepaid. If u try the other way around it won't work and PayPal will un verify and it won't readd
2017-06-21 21:59:51 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: I use Walmarts bluebird prepaid. No montly fee
2017-06-21 22:00:45 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Also free card loading at Walmart
2017-06-21 22:00:52 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Well the prepaid would be used in stores. The money would never go back to paypal.
2017-06-21 22:00:56 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Only from paypal.
2017-06-21 22:01:03 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: So would that work?
2017-06-21 22:01:12 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Yes
2017-06-21 22:02:26 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: What info does Bluebird require?
2017-06-21 22:02:42 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: Ideally I would never return to Walmart lol.
2017-06-21 22:04:02 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Just confirming identify and address. That's it. U can order it free from bluebird. And just wait for the card in the mail if u want
2017-06-21 22:04:37 #webpage-development @CaptainJim#5590: That would be a good way to keep it separated from my personal accounts.
2017-06-21 22:05:09 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: Think if I give a promo code we get a reward not sure let me look lol

2017-06-21 22:49:32 #webpage-development @VyrenGames#3859: i wanted to remove it entirely, but you cant because its a goddamn iframe
2017-06-21 22:49:40 #webpage-development @TroyFoxxin#9341: i can also get the live map to embed into the site now but it pops up a error and redirects away from the site.
