2017-06-22 00:07:10 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: I made this a little bit more personable. What do you think?
2017-06-23 16:06:51 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: @CaptainJim So the wipes are weekly?
2017-06-23 20:37:04 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: @Grapes Yes? Does that help or hurt you?
2017-07-06 14:37:05 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: Idk it's kinda a pain in the ass lol but if it says it helps server then it helps the server people in vanilla are willing to do that. But again this is not really a vanilla server.
2017-07-06 14:37:56 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: I get that the rates are vanilla but it just doesn't work when your vanilla with mods and one week wipe cycle
2017-07-06 17:22:38 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Right we already talked about this and I said I was gonna change the gather rate. So does that work for you? If we just up the gather?
2017-07-06 17:36:32 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: I guess
2017-07-06 18:22:15 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: I'm just asking.
2017-07-06 18:23:40 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Changing the gather rate allows us to keep the plugins we have, but if you want it flat vanilla then I can reset it all pretty quick.
2017-07-06 18:23:53 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Just whatever works for you grapes.
2017-07-06 18:43:24 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: I'm fine with the father rate turned up but what kinda fucking server are we running?? VANILLA OR MODDED?
2017-07-06 18:43:40 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: We wanted to be vanilla but we're turning to modded
2017-07-06 19:02:30 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: @​everyone Does anyone remember ever saying whether we were vanilla or modded? I don't remember anything about that, but you know me. 🤗
2017-07-06 19:04:34 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: All I remember was Jim initially saying the server would show up in the modded section of the server list, but beyond that I'm drawing a blank.
2017-07-06 19:11:52 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: Actually Vyren I don't know who you are?
2017-07-06 19:23:50 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: The server title says vanilla lol.
2017-07-06 19:25:02 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: We can go back to vanilla or I can change the gather rate to 2x. I think that's what we gotta figure it out unless you have other suggestions.
2017-07-06 20:46:45 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: 2x
2017-07-06 20:47:03 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: And change the name no vanilla
2017-07-06 20:48:31 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: ^^^
2017-07-06 20:48:40 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Ya, please don't go back to vanilla.
2017-07-06 20:49:17 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: We just have to get all the right mods and then see where we end up I guess.
2017-07-06 21:01:33 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Well yeah Imma change the name lol
2017-07-06 21:01:52 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Are you okay with 7 day wipes, still?
2017-07-06 21:03:02 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: I think we should host an event. It looks like Vyren has about 400 followers. If we could get just 10% of those people on at the same time we'd be on the map.
2017-07-06 21:04:10 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: As I was looking and reaching out to other streamers I thought of this: Vyren titles his stream something like come play with us ya know. Viewers always want to know the server.
2017-07-06 21:04:40 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: And we could build some mega base and challenge everyone to raid it.
2017-07-06 21:07:04 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: I like that idea.
2017-07-06 21:07:20 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: I'll see if anyone's interested.
2017-07-06 21:07:28 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: What?
2017-07-06 21:08:01 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Who has to interested other than you lol
2017-07-06 21:09:49 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Anywho. We make the base and then we try and raid the base. Invite people to help. Take a step back and watch people enjoy themselves. That's my idea. A majority of why we aren't populated is because we aren't populated. Which is really stupid, but because we don't have consistent users people see it's empty and leave.
2017-07-06 21:10:57 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Or it could be lag because I have no way of knowing if it lags for people father away.
2017-07-06 21:11:39 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: I mean I'll see if any of my followers are interested in a little Rust party
2017-07-06 21:11:51 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Oh I thought you just did it.
2017-07-06 21:12:24 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Well, I wanna see if I can get a group together. Not all viewers want to/are able to play.
2017-07-06 21:13:11 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Right. You'd have grapes and I of course. I see what you mean. I made buddies with a new streamer he might be interested.
2017-07-06 21:13:18 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: I'll reach out via Twitter and the TeamEmmmmsie Discord. Try and reach as many people as possible.
2017-07-06 21:13:29 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Really? Cool.
2017-07-06 21:13:50 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: We could do a co-op stream if they're interested.
2017-07-06 21:13:56 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Should we build it before we start all the PR?
2017-07-06 21:14:34 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: We can copy the base and paste it later, too. That totally works and I love  it.
2017-07-06 21:15:13 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: True
2017-07-06 21:15:26 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: We gotta get on that.
2017-07-06 21:15:42 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Then once we're all ready I'll reach out.
2017-07-06 21:15:53 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Also is this a Wednesday thing? That would be right before a wipe. Would that be better or worse?
2017-07-06 21:16:24 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: C may want to join us. We all bought this game lol
2017-07-06 21:16:44 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Worse because if people want to come back after and find that everything is gone they'll be upset.
2017-07-06 21:16:52 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: Ikr
2017-07-06 21:17:04 #the-originals @VyrenGames#3859: We should all be there.
2017-07-06 21:17:22 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Okayokay. So we'll stock the building with good shit and do it on a Friday.
2017-07-06 21:17:39 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: Then anybody who got to steal shit has a reason to stay for the week.
2017-07-06 21:19:37 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: We wipe today so we can make the building this weekend or next week. Then it wipes again on Thursday we can paste it back that night.
2017-07-06 21:19:48 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: @Grapes Keeping up? How does this sound.

2017-07-07 01:26:45 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: I like the mega base idea... we could have it and then we can hold an event every Thursday before it wipes and we could give people c4 and they could try... but only in THURDAYS..
2017-07-07 01:29:05 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: Streamers are good to get and if we can get other people like your followers.. Vyren then we can probably grow this server..
2017-07-07 01:31:45 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: I also want to point this out... THIS SERVER HAD BEEN UP FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AND GETTING POEPLE TAKES TIME TO GET ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.... THOSE BIG SERVERS TAKE A YEAR MAYBE MORE.. AND THEY HAVE YOUTUBERS AND WELL KNOWN PEOPLE PLAYING ON THE SERVER.... IF WE START GETTING SOME STREAMS OR VIDEOS GOING ON THE SERVER WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE THE LIBK AND THEY CAN CHECK IT OUT.
2017-07-07 01:32:49 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: But I like those ideas and I think those would help
2017-07-07 01:35:36 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: All we need is people and when we have people we have to interact with them.. the mega base situation would be really cool... if w give everyone 10 or 20 c4 then we can defend and we can all just have a good time.... I can build the mega base but only if it is always there... every once in a while we can change it up a bit and build something else.
2017-07-07 01:36:54 #the-originals @Grapes#5121: Alright I think I've said enough let me know
2017-07-07 04:51:01 #the-originals @CaptainJim#5590: So much caps lock.
