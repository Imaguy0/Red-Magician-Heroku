2017-06-17 15:07:19 #general @CaptainJim#5590: Maybe yeah. There was a slight data loss when I was reconfiguring the restarting process.
2017-06-17 15:08:06 #general @CaptainJim#5590: I thought I added you back already, but I'll look again tonight around 16:00 CST
2017-06-18 01:38:57 #general @CaptainJim#5590: @BlackBerry4465 I found the issue and it should be solved, but requires a good restart.
2017-06-18 01:39:44 #general @BlackBerry4465#9512: When will it restart
2017-06-18 02:30:35 #general @Grapes#5121: When is the restart jim?
2017-06-18 04:17:47 #general @Grapes#5121: @CaptainJim can you make sure that the admins have the commands unlocked I can't seem to go in God mode and I also and having trouble spawning in High Quality Metal. What do you type in when you spawn the high quality metal??
2017-06-18 15:06:00 #general @CaptainJim#5590: @Grapes Look up the commands, yes they are available to you. The restart already happened blackberry should be back to normal now.
2017-06-18 15:06:20 #general @Grapes#5121: ok
2017-06-18 15:07:03 #general @Grapes#5121: can you tell me what you say to spawn in high guality metal i cant seem to get it to work
2017-06-18 15:46:48 #general @CaptainJim#5590: refined
2017-06-18 15:58:35 #general @Grapes#5121: It keeps giving me 1 \
2017-06-18 16:55:00 #general @Grapes#5121: This is the command I am doing inventory.give refined high quality metal 100000 but it just keeps giving me one when I do that
2017-06-18 17:28:29 #general @CaptainJim#5590: Just refined.
2017-06-18 18:16:18 #general @VyrenGames#3859: its because the name of the item is just "refined".
2017-06-18 18:18:23 #general @VyrenGames#3859: The computer thinks you're asking for refined metal "high" times, but since "high" isn't an integer, it just gives you one instead.
2017-06-18 21:10:55 #general @VyrenGames#3859: lol

2017-06-28 20:31:58 #general @Grapes#5121: I'll be on rust I guess....
2017-07-01 17:04:44 #general @CaptainJim#5590: Would it populate if I doubled the gather rate?
2017-07-03 18:37:59 #general @VyrenGames#3859: Maybe. That might help because I notice a lot of popular servers have gather rates of around 10000 on everything. Not saying it should be that high, but you know.
2017-07-03 19:15:59 #general @CaptainJim#5590: We should all get together and play someone else's server.
2017-07-03 19:52:28 #general @Grapes#5121: The reason the Vanilla server is not popular it's because it's in the modded section. It needs to be in the vanilla section in order to catch people's attention... the vanilla people don't look in the modded section if we want people you take the mods off and put it in the vanilla section of rust... vanilla servers most of the time they get more people then modded. The reason the other vanilla servers are doing so good is because they've been around for almost the time the game has been out... becoming popular takes time but once people keep playing on our server it will keep popping up and people are going to want to try it...
2017-07-03 20:02:51 #general @CaptainJim#5590: Well the mods are super helpful so how about we just change the gather rate? Then all the modded people will like us?
2017-07-03 20:32:25 #general @Grapes#5121: I've said before the only way our name is going to get out there... is the someone would do streams or some shit but I'm not going to spend all my time trying to get our name out there...
2017-07-03 21:21:23 #general @CaptainJim#5590: I alreadt started talking to some streamers just nothing has worked out yet.
2017-07-04 00:09:58 #general @Grapes#5121: Okay
2017-07-05 00:04:15 #general @VyrenGames#3859: I like the idea of checking out other servers.
2017-07-05 00:05:20 #general @VyrenGames#3859: Also, I looked at a server that had zombies, and I'm fairly certain they're either just an addon for or a custom setup for the NPC plugin we got.
2017-07-06 14:35:35 #general @Grapes#5121: I like those servers they drop loot and there somewhat a pain in the ASS... they only spawn in radtowns.. but it could be difficult if people don't have guns but I personally think we should add that.
2017-07-17 01:38:34 #general @VyrenGames#3859: Ya, the one I was on had zombies that dropped ammo, so the more you killed the more ammo you got. They also had a pistol in case you didn't already have a gun.
2017-07-29 17:41:09 #general @ItsGrrrrrrrapes#5121: @CaptainJim Im on rust at the moment and i dont see the server in my favorited server list!!
2017-07-29 20:19:09 #general @CaptainJim#5590: It's off.
2017-07-29 20:19:53 #general @CaptainJim#5590: I just didn't have it in me to wipe and reboot yesterday.
2017-07-29 20:30:04 #general @VyrenGames#3859: lol
2017-07-29 21:03:58 #general @ItsGrrrrrrrapes#5121: can you please put it back up
